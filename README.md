# Slim Framework Based To Do App 

Working with the MVC Framework Slim. 
Back end in PHP, light front end using HTML/CSS only.





This skeleton application was built for Composer. 

## Install the Application

Create a new directory with your project name, e.g:


```bash
mkdir Project
```

Once inside the new directory, clone this repo.

One cloned, you must install the slim components by running:

```bash
composer install
```

To run the application locally:
```bash
composer start

```
Run this command in the application directory to run the test suite
```bash
composer test
```

That's it! Now go build something cool.
